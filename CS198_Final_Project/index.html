                        California Sea Lions are found from British Columbia to Mexico, favoring the California coast. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        They belong to the order <span class="highlighted-text">Pinnipedia</span>, a clade consisting of seals, sea lions, fur seals and walruses.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As part of the <span class="highlighted-text">Otariid</span> Family, California Sea Lions are distingushuable from other Pinnipeds by their external ears, or <span class="highlighted-text">pinnae</span>, and their ability to use their front flippers to sit upright and “walk”.  
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        They are social creatures and you will often find them sunbathing on haul-out sites or on land. Great spots to find California Sea Lions in the bay area are at Fisherman’s Wharf in SF and Monterey Bay.
