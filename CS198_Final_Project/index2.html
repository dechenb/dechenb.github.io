        Male California Sea Lions have a bony bump on top of their heads, known as a <span class="highlighted-text">sagittal crest</span> which allows them to have tremendous bite force. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Can you think of why male sea lions might need a strong bite?
    </div>
    <div class="righteous hidden" id = "flipper-text">
        Within the flipper are bones similar to the bones in our  hands. When different species share the same feature from a common ancestor, itâ€™s called a <span class="highlighted-text">homologous structure</span>!
    </div>
    <div class="righteous hidden" id = "tail-text">
        California Sea Lions use their tails for <span class="highlighted-text">thermoregulation</span>. By peeking their tails or flippers out of the water while remaining submerged, they can either use the sun to warm up their body or use the wind to cool off.
